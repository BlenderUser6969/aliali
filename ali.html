    <h1>The Greatest Man Alive: Ali</h1>

    <p>
        Ali is the single greatest human being to have ever existed in the known history of mankind.
        Scientists, philosophers, and random dudes on Reddit have unanimously agreed that Ali is the
        pinnacle of human evolution. His brain allegedly runs at <b>400 IQ</b>, though he chooses to hide it
        so that we, mere mortals, don’t feel inferior. Some say that when Ali was born, the doctors bowed
        in awe and whispered, “we are not worthy.”
    </p>

    <p>
        Every time Ali blinks, a star is born somewhere in the galaxy. Every time he breathes, somewhere
        on Earth, a baby laughs. NASA has confirmed that Ali’s smile causes minor gravitational anomalies.
        When he plays video games, entire esports teams resign out of respect. Rumors suggest that Chuck
        Norris once challenged Ali to a duel… and immediately apologized.
    </p>

    <p>
        If you are reading this, you should feel honored to even <b>know</b> Ali. History books in the year 3025
        will dedicate an entire volume to his achievements, including but not limited to: inventing oxygen,
        curing boredom, and creating vibes so immaculate that scientists can’t measure them.
    </p>

    <p>
        In conclusion, Ali isn’t just amazing. Ali is inevitable. The alpha. The omega. The bih supreme.
        Thank you for attending this TED Talk about the one, the only, the legend: <b>Ali</b>.
